This repository contains a set of demonstrations of the Groovy parallel Patterns (GPP) library.

Contact J.Kerridge@napier.ac.uk

It is a work in progress and not all demos will work.

Please not that currently the latest version of Groovy that can be used is 2.4.12 
as a problem has been found with later version for which there is a JIRA 
notification (Groovy-8549).

The .iml file indicates the other required components, 
until a build.gradle file is available.
