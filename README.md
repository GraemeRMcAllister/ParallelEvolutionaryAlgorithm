Graeme McAllister Honours project code - original Groovy demonstratinf from J. Kerridge with permission


_______________________________________________________________________________________________
This repository contains a set of demonstrations of the Groovy parallel Patterns (GPP) library.

Contact J.Kerridge@napier.ac.uk

It is a work in progress and not all demos will work.

It should be noted that some problems were found with some of the Groovy releases, 
in particular versions after 2.4.12 and some of the early versions of 2.5.x and
3.0.0-alpha-1 did not work.

It is known that the demos do work with the current release of groovy 2.5.x and 
3.0.0-alpha-3 onwards.

The gradle build file for the project does load the required components depending on the
version of groovy used.
